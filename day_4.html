        <p id="daystart">For the fourth day you will be training <b>legs</b>. This is the dreaded day for a lot of people but trust me leg days are really fun if you choose the right workouts. You use your legs everyday so it's important to develop them correctly too.</p>

                <h6>The hamstrings are one of the largest muscles in the thigh region and they allow your hip to move the leg behind the body, this is one of the most important muscles to train if you walk/run a lot. The glutes are one of the most important and overlooked muscles, their job is to basically keep the body upright and this contributes a lot to one's posture and could greatly combat lower back pain due to poor posture. </h6>

                <h6>The abudctor muscles allow the ability to bring the thighs to each other, this is called abduction and can be progressively trained. The Quads are basically on the opposite side of the hamstrings and they allow you to flex the hip, (useful when sitting, squatting or extending the knee). This muscle could be easily trained with squates, leg presses and compound excercises that take advantage of the movement and involvement of the knee.  </h6>

        <h4 id="BarbellSquats"><mark>Barbell squats (4 sets of 10)</mark></h4>
        <p>Squats are key for leg days and we start with barbell squats as it as a great compound movement that emphasizes building the lower body muscles and help strength.   </p>
        <h5>How to perform Barbell Squats</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by placing the barbell on top of your traps (back), make sure you have a hip-width stance with the feet placed in a comfortable position. </li>
            <li>Descend slowly by flexing the knees, try not to move your hips back too much and keep your torso as upright as possible (your feet should not leave the floor). </li>
            <li>Continue all the way down till the upper legs reach the lower legs then reverse the movement slowly  </li>
        </ol>

        <h4 id="LegPress"><mark>Leg Press (4 sets of 12)</mark></h4>
        <p>Leg presses are also a very popular excercise that targets the quads and can be progressively overloaded to allow for amazing strength build up </p>
        <h5>How to perform the Leg Press</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Load the machine with appropriate weights then sit down on the machine and place your legs in front of you at a medium stance. </li>
            <li>Brace your core and press your legs forward then lower the safety handles on the side and press forward your legs until they are fully extended (be sure not to lock your knees), this is your starting position. </li>
            <li>While you inhale slowly lower the platform till your lower and upper legs make a 90 degree angle. </li>
            <li>Push/press back the platforms using your quads and heels to go back to the starting position and be sure to lock the safety handle after you have completed the number of reps. </li>
        </ol>

        <h4 id="LegExtensions"><mark>Leg Extensions (3 sets of 10 reps) </mark></h4>
        <p>Leg extensions are another excercise that mainly isolates the quads and strengthen the knees allowing for a much stronger squat. </p>
        <h5>How to perform Leg Extensions</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>For this excercise you require a leg extension machine. Start by selecting an appropriate weight then sit on the machine with your legs under the cushioned pad and hold the bars on the side for grip. </li>
            <li>Using your quads extend your legs as much as you can and make sure your body doesnt move around too much. Pause for 2 seconds at the peak. </li>
            <li>Slowly lower back the weight to the starting position and repeat. </li>
        </ol>

        <h4 id="StandingRaises"><mark>Standing Calf Raises (4 sets of 12 reps) </mark></h4>
        <p>The standing calf raises is a very simply excercise that targets the calf muscles of the lower leg, this excercise could be done weighted (while holding a weight) or without one. Double amount of reps if done unweighted.</p>
        <h5>How to perform Standing Calf Raises </h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Stand up straight then raise your heel so that you are standing on your toes. </li>
            <li>Slowly lower back to the starting position and repeat. </li>
        </ol>
