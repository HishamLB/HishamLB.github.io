        <p id="daystart">For day one of the routine you will be targetting the <b>Chest</b> and <b>triceps</b> with vairious excercies that will be crucial for building muscle. </p>
        <h2><mark>Chest: </mark></h2>
        <p>The chest muscles/pectoralis main purpose is abduction and flexion of the shoulder. Excercising the chest muscles is very important in developing upper body strength/physique and position. In order to train and excercise effeciently all the import chest muscle regions have to be worked. That is the upper, middle and lower pecs (image 2.1). </p>

        <h4 id="BenchPress"><mark>Dumbell Bench Press (3 sets of 12) </mark></h4>
        <p>The dumbell bench press is a stable for any chest workout and so there's no reason to not include it in this workout. Remember to keep your form right like shown in the gif below to avoid any risk of injury. </p>
        <h5>How to perform a Dumbell Bench Press</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Lie down flat on your back on a bench</li>
            <li>Grab a pair of dumbells, if you're new to working out you might want to start really low, pair of 10 pound dumbells would do just fine for beginners. </li>
            <li>strengthen your core and lift the dumbells above your chest. Squeeze your shoulder blades while lowering them and that's 1 rep(itation).</li>
        </ol>

        <h4 id="Crossovers"><mark>Cable Crossovers (4 sets of 10) </mark></h4>
        <p>Like we talked about before one of the biggest uses of the chest is abduction, so we are really tapping in that and trying to train the function..</p>
        <h5>How to perform Cable Crossovers</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Set both sides of the pully machine to a high level and stand in the middle of the machine with feet shoulder width apart.</li>
            <li>Grab the 2 handles and bend slightly forward.</li>
            <li>While keeping your core engaged pull both handles close to each other and squeeze your chest muscles then slowly reverse to starting position</li>
        </ol>

        <h4 id="InclineBenchPress"><mark>Incline Bench Press (3 sets of 10) </mark></h4>
        <p>You might be confused, another bench press?! Well chest workouts mostly utilize bench presses then pressing is one of the chest's major functions. In this variation of the bench press we are mostly looking to target the upper part of the chest. Make sure the bench is adjusted to between 15 and 30 degrees and perform the bench press just like you did in the first excercise. </p>

        <h4 id="Dips"><mark>Dips (3 sets of 10) </mark></h4>
        <p>We have our last exercise here for the chest workouts and you are going to do dips. This could be pretty hard for you to do at first so if your gym has it maybe try a aided dip.</p>
        <h5>How to perform Dips</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Grab the handles of a dip station then press yourself by straightening your arm. </li>
            <li> Lean forward a bit and you can even bend your knees slightly if you please. Lower your body by bending your elbows till your arms are bout 90 degrees;</li>
            <li>While focusing on your form press upward to the starting position.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2><mark>Triceps: </mark></h2>
        <p>The triceps are a very important muscles, from the name 'tri' it has 3 heads. A long head, a lateral head and a medial head and so just like with chest we have to make sure we target every part of the muscle to train effectively.  </p>
        <h4 id="ClosePinPress"><mark>Close grip pin press (3 sets of 10) </mark></h4>
        <p>The first excercise in the triceps part of the workout would be the close grip pin press. You might be wondering well why are we only doing a close grip press instead of just a normal full range of motion press? Well if we want to grow our triceps we have to try and isolate that part and so it is important to note that the triceps work only around the midpoint of the press which is why we only do that part. </p>
        <h5>How to perform the Close Grip Pin Press</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Set up the safety pins in the rack just above chest height and load the bar with appropriate weights.</li>
            <li>Pinch your shoulder blades together, take a deep breath then lift off the bar, be sure to keep your core tight and engaged</li>
            <li>Slowly descend the bar (controlled) until the bar reaches the pins</li>
            <li>Pause for around 2 seconds then push the bar back up while driving your feet to the ground and extending the elbows.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4 id="Pushdowns"><mark>Rope pushdowns (4 sets of 12) </mark></h4>

        <p>Next we do one of the most misperformed excercise. This is commonly done incorrectly by a lot of people causing inefficient training so be sure to follow the instructions and visual guidance! Attach the rope grip to a pushdown machine then stand a bit less than shoulder-width apart and brace your abdominals. Tuck your elbows and be sure not to flare them at all throughout the movement, inhale then push down until your elbows are extended (do not lock them) while still keeping your back straight and core engaged exhale while slowly returning to the starting position. <b>Do this for 4 sets of 13 reps.   </b></p>
        <h5>How to perform Rope Pushdowns</h5>
            <ol>
            <li>Attach the rope grip to a pushdown machine then stand a bit less than shoulder-width apart and brace your abdominals. </li>
            <li>Tuck your elbows and be sure not to flare them at all throughout the movement, inhale then push down until your elbows are extended (do not lock them)</li>
            <li>hile still keeping your back straight and core engaged exhale while slowly returning to the starting position.</li>
