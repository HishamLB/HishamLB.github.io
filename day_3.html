        <h1>Day Three </h1>
    </div>

    <body>
        <p id="daystart">For the third day of the routine you will be doing <b>shoulders</b> and <b>forearms</b>.</p>
        <h2><mark>Shoulders: </mark></h2>
        <p>Shoulders/delts are crucial muscles when it comes to overall upper body strength as they are connected to the chest and arms. The Deltoids, Teres Major and Rotater Cuff all come in mind when developing a great shoulder workout so they will be trained here.</p>

                <h6>The Delts/Deltoids are very important muscles that are responsible for everything to do with arm abduction, rotation, extension and all of that.They also help stabilize the entire shoulder joint. These muscles are very crucial to train as they provide immense strength to the body. </h6>

                <th><img src="images\shoulder_side.png" alt="Side of the shoulder" height="214px" width="300px"></th>
                <h6>The Rotator cuff muscles are one of the most hated muscles as they limit trainers in other excercises so often. These muscles work with the arm and shoulder joint to provide mobility and internal rotation of the arm. They can be a big bottleneck in compound excercises like the bench press so it is crucial to train them.</h6>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <th><img src="images\shoulder_back.png" alt="Back of the shoulder" height="214px" width="300px"></th>
                <h6>The Traps/Trapezius muscles are responsible for elevating the shoulder blade and tilting it when the arm is moved. Even though technically speaking the traps are in the back their function is heavily related to the shoulder and so they are here. They move, stabilize and rotate the scapula. These are the muscles that work the most when we shrug. </h6>

        <h2><mark>Forearms: </mark></h2>
        <p>Forearms are very overlooked when it comes to workout routines but it's really important for fleshing out your arms and not introducing any bottlenecks to your strength and physique. There's 3 main muscles in the forearm and they are the Brachioradialis, extensors and flexors. Training these muscles will help build large strong forearms.</p>

        <h4 id="ReverseCurls"><mark>Barbell reverse curls (4 sets of 15) </mark></h4>
        <p>We have already talked about normal barbell curls in the bicep excercies on day 2 but now we are reversing it to target the extensor muscles. This excercise is very important to build forearm muscles and so we will be utilizing it in this workout. </p>
        <h5>How to perform Barbell Reverse Curls</h5>

        <ol>
            <li>Start with a barbell loaded with weights 10 pounds lighter than what you would use for a normal barbell curl.</li>
            <li>Stand up with feet hip-width apart and grab the barbell with an overhand grip then slowly curl the barbell up slighty above 90 degrees. </li>
            <li>Slowly return to the starting position and repeat.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4 id="HammerCurls"><mark>Hammer curls (4 sets of 12) </mark></h4>
        <p>Next you are going to do hammer curls which heavily utilize all 3 muscles we mentioned at the start, which are very important if you perform any sports where throwing is a thing. To do this excercise hold the dumbbells by your side with neutral wrists. Next curl up the weights upwards and inwards towards your chest. Repeat for 4 sets of 12 reps.</p>
